edbee-data
==========

These are the data files used by the [edbee application](https://github.com/edbee/edbee-app).  

Originally these files were bundled in the code tree of edbee. Because most of these files have external origins, and are not required to use edbee, these are seperated into it's own repository.

The data consists out of
 * syntaxfiles: Here are some example Textmate grammar files. More definition can be found here on github. 
 * themes: Here are some example Textmate Theme files. Used for syntax highlighting. 
 * keymaps: These are the default keymaps used by edbee. 
 * config: These are the default configuration settings for edbee.
